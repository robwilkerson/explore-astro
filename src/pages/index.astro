    <p>I build things with bytes.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer and leader with over 20 years of experience
      designing, architecting, and developing Internet solutions. For the last
      10 years or so, I've been building, growing, and leading remote teams of
      software engineers both nationally and internationally.
    </p>
    <p>
      In days of yore, I spent time as an architect, a carpenter, and a
      paratrooper, but never a butcher, baker, or candlestick maker.
    </p>
    <p>I am friend to all dogs and most bartenders.</p>
